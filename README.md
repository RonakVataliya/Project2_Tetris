## 🎯 Overview ✨📝
This is a console-based implementation of the classic Tetris game written in C++. It features:

- Real-time gameplay with keyboard controls.
- Progressive speed increase as the game progresses.
- High score tracking saved to a file.

## 🖥️ Requirements 🔧⚡
- 🪟 Windows OS (due to usage of Windows-specific headers like `<windows.h>` and `_kbhit()` for keyboard input).
- 🛠️ A C++ compiler that supports C++11 or higher (e.g., MinGW, MSVC).

# Data Structures Used 🗂

- *vector<vector<int>>*: Stores the game grid and individual Tetromino shapes.  
- *vector<vector<vector<int>>*: Holds predefined Tetromino shapes.  
- *Tetromino (Class)*: Represents a falling piece with its shape, position, and color.  
- *Game (Class)*: Manages game logic, user input, rendering, and score tracking. 

## Data Members:
- grid: 2D vector representing the game board.
- currentPiece: Stores the currently active Tetromino.
- score: Tracks the player's score.
- highScore: Stores the highest recorded score.
- speed: Controls the drop speed of Tetrominoes.
- isGameOver: Boolean flag to indicate the end of the game.

## 🏗️ How to Compile 🖱️💻
Use the following command to compile the game (assuming `g++` is installed):

```bash
g++ -o tetris tetris.cpp
```

## 🚀 How to Run 📂⚙️
Run the compiled executable:

```bash
./tetris
```

## 🎮 Game Controls 🕹️🔄
| Key      | Action                     |
|----------|----------------------------|
| `A` or Left Arrow | 🔙 Move piece left            |
| `D` or Right Arrow| 🔜 Move piece right           |
| `S` or Down Arrow | ⬇️ Move piece down faster     |
| `W` or Up Arrow   | 🔄 Rotate the piece           |
| `Space`           | ⬇️ Drop piece instantly       |
| `P`               | ⏸️ Pause/Unpause the game     |
| `R`               | 🔄 Restart the game           |
| `ESC`             | ❌ Quit the game              |


## 🌟  Key Features 🚀🎮
- ⚡ *Dynamic Speed Adjustment:*
    - 🚀 The drop speed of the tetrominoes increases by 10% after every 5 pieces placed, with a minimum speed cap of 50ms. ⚡⏱📈
- 🏆 *High Score Tracking:*
    - 📄 The highest score is saved in a file named highscore.txt and loaded at the start of the game. 🏆📄💾
- 🎨 *Game Rendering:*
    - 🔳 The game grid and pieces are rendered using simple console characters.
    - 📊 The current score, high score, and drop speed are displayed after each update. 🎨📊🧱
- 🔄 *Pause and Restart:*
    - ⏯ The game can be paused or restarted at any time using the respective keys. 🔄⏸⚙

## 📄 Files 🗂️💽
- `tetris.cpp` - 📄 The main C++ source code containing the game logic.
- `highscore.txt` - 🏆 A file that stores the highest score achieved.

## 🧠 Code Highlights 💡🔍
- 🔄 **Tetromino Management:**
    - 🟩 Each tetromino is represented as a 2D vector.
    - 🔄 Pieces can be rotated and moved within the grid. 🔄🟩⬛
- 🚫 **Collision Detection:**
    - ⚠️ Ensures that pieces don't overlap or go beyond the game boundaries. 🚫⚠️🧱
- 🗺️ **Game Grid:**
    - 📊 Maintained as a 2D vector representing the current state of the board. 🗺️📊🔢
- 🖥️ **Console Handling:**
    - ⚙️ The console cursor is managed for smooth rendering using Windows API functions. 🖥️🖱️⚙️

## ⚠️ Limitations ⛔🚧
- 🚫 Only works on Windows due to the usage of specific libraries.
- 🎨 Basic visual design due to console-based rendering.

## 🚀 Possible Enhancements 🔮💡
- 🌍 Cross-platform support by replacing Windows-specific code.
- 🎨 Adding colors for different tetrominoes using ANSI escape codes.
- 🖥 Implementing more advanced graphics using libraries like SDL or SFML.
- 🔊 Adding sound effects and background music.
-  Game Enhancements & Features
✅ Ghost Piece: Show a faint preview of where the current piece will land.
- ✅ Hold Piece Feature: Allow players to swap the current piece with a "held" piece.
- ✅ Next Piece Preview (Multiple Pieces):Show the next 3-5 upcoming tetrominoes instead of just one.
